    "\n",
    "Ans: A box tuple is a type of data structure that stores an ordered collection of values, which        can be of different data types. It is similar to a list, but it is immutable, meaning that        its elements cannot be changed once they are created. A box tuple is defined by enclosing        its elements in parentheses and separated by commas, like this: (element1, element2, ...).        The elements can be accessed by indexing the box tuple, just like with a list. Box tuples        are commonly used in functional programming to represent values that should not be changed,      making it easier to reason about the program's behavior and prevent unintended side-effects."
